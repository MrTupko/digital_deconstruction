				<p>Fake horses, actual chaos...</p>
				<P>*looks up at the camera with an air of superiority*</p>

				<p>Ah, yes... Python.</p>
				<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that's often used
						for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Development: rapid prototyping, web development, and more.</li>
					<li>Scientific computing: libraries like NumPy and SciPy make it perfect for
						data analysis and
						scientific simulations.</li>
					<li>Automation: write scripts to automate repetitive tasks and workflows.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>*leans in closer*</p>

				<p>And of course, Elliot also wrote a lot of Python code... *whispers* if you know what
					I
					mean.</p>

				<h2 class="small-title">Digital Subversion</h2>
				<p>Because even hackers deserve to look cool.</p>
				<p>(smirking) Ah, the ignorance is bliss, isn't it? People think they can just be me, a
					force of
					chaos in this crumbling system. (pausing, studying you) You think being "cool"
					is all about
					style and confidence, huh?</p>

				<p>Listen up, kid. In the game I play, appearances don't matter. It's not about looks;
					it's about
					results. Can you get inside their system? Make them think twice? Break them like
					a cipher?</p>

				<p>But hey, if you wanna waste your time pretending to be a "cool" hacker...be my guest.
					Go wear
					those skinny jeans and those bright red sunglasses while you try to stay one
					step ahead. (eyeing you dismissively) I got more important things to do.</p>

				<p>You think being a hacker is just about pulling pranks, getting that next thrill?
					That's
					amateur hour. (taking out my earpiece) It's all just digital graffiti until you
					get real
					leverage.</p>

				<p>(Leaning in closer) So, either step up or shut down. The only "style" I concern
					myself with is
					exploiting every weak point in the system â€“ style-wise and financially. And by
					God,
					kid...you're going to have a whole lot of respect for my craft once you see how
					much it's
					about more than just coding some nifty app...</p>

			<article class="work-card web">
				<h2 class="small-title">About me</h2>
				<p>*nods, a hint of an edge in his voice*</p>


				<p>I build things. Websites. Apps. The occasional digital deception device. My skills
					lie in web
					development, particularly with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It's an ideal playground
					for a
					"phoenix"... like myself.</p>

				<p>A few lines of code can change everything. The anonymity I need to stay under the
					radar. The
					access I crave into seemingly impenetrable systems... The digital veil is thin;
					but I'm
					getting better at navigating it.</p>

				<p>Your name is probably encoded in a way that would take even a seasoned pro to crack.
					Yet, if
					you think about it...</p>

				<p>*stops, looks around nervously*</p>

				<p>Perhaps that's what draws me to coding... The idea that I can rewrite reality, just
					for a
					moment, until the next security patch, the next bug report.</p>

				<p>It's never enough; there's always another layer to break through, another encryption
					protocol
					to disable. That search for perfection, for freedom from the chains of societal
					conformity...</p>

				<p>*stares directly into your soul*</p>

				<p>That's me... A perpetual wanderer in the depths of code and digital obscurity.</p>

				<p>Now, don't ask questions you wouldn't want answers to. And above all...</P>

				<h3 class="small-title">Why Debian Linux?</h3>

					<p> Debian's got control, security, and anonymity. Customizable, hackable, and unbreakable when done right. It's for those who 
						understand, not just use. (winking) Trust me, kid.</p>
